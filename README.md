PROBLEM 1.

At first I'm searching for the most advantageous price in $pricesAndPurchases array from price values with built in 
functions array column(), which goes through only price values, and with built in function max() I get the most 
advantageous price.
Then, I'm searching for this values index in array with built in function array_search(), so I can use it in for loop.
I iterate through array (through days from 0 to 3) and get the sum of purchased units and spent money from day 0 to 3.
Finally, I'm calculating spent money from day 0 to 3 and then get the profit. 

PROBLEM 2.

To calculate minimum cost of transforming from string $src into string $tgt, I use built in function levenshtein().

PROBLEM 3.

Looping through array $values and comparing each value with the next one. If current value is smaller than next one,
the smallest will be returned.
